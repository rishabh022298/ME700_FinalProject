# Crack Propagation due to Spatially Varying Temperature Field

## Motivation

Problems related to growth and fracture have been a topic of interest for some time now. Not only these systems are rich in physics but we also get to observe some very beautiful patterns and colors, for example check out this work by [Atis et al](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.021058) about how a yeast colony tears itself apart in search for nutrients:

Here's another example from [Plummer et al](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sm/d3sm01470c) in which a hydrogel is allowed to swell in a constrained environment.
